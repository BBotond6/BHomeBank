# BHomeBank

## Concept
Using multiple bank accounts makes it more difficult to keep track of your transactions and balance.<br>
With this project I want to develop a program that can process exported data from multiple bank accounts.<br>
I would like to save the data on my own SQL server so that no third party can access it.<br>
I would like to create transaction analysis operations that take into the data of all bank accounts.

## Current State
The current state is able to read and store in a vector the exported data from OTP internet bank and Revolut.

## Future Plans
- Various transaction analysis operations.
- Create SQL database using Raspberry Pi and HDD.
- Storing transaction data on the server.
- Establishing an internet connection between the server and the computer.
